Minimal exemples using Peak Linux driver with Xenomai:

xenomai_receive_test.c
xenomai_transmitt_test.c
Makefile 

Purpose of these files is not replace receivetest and transmitest programs.
They should be used as an "Hello world" program, providing a sane environment 
to start a new project, with a working Makefile.

How to start : 
	- install xenomai and peak linux driver
	- copy the minimal_xenomai directory in your workspace
	- call make, to check everything works fine
	- start modifying to fit your needs
